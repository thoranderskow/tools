remind is a tool that allows you to keep a log of things to be reminded about and you can clear, undo, or remove items from the log.

webscrape.py is a python program that I used to learn about webscraping with BeautifulSoup. It scrapes and presents information from weather sites and a site called elitesmash.com or elitegsp.com to show current temperatures of Oklahoma City and Woodland Hills, and the average gsp to get into elite smash.
